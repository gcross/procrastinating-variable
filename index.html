      Haskell values that cannot be evaluated immediately.
    </div>

    <p>Procrastinating variables ('PVar's) are meant to be used in cases where
you want to give someone a value that you do not have available yet,
but will definitely have ready by the time that they need to use it.</p>

    <p>'PVar's have the advantage that you do not make the user of your value
execute some kind of unwrapping routine in order to get access to the
value within.  For example, this is useful when you are constructing
closures that you want to go ahead and construct now even though some
of the values that they contain are not available yet.</p>

    <p>'PVar's are implemented with a lazy thunk that reads from
an IORef; before the IORef is written to, it contains "bottom" (an
exception with a descriptive error message) so that an error is raised
in the user code if the variable is accidently accessed before the
value is ready. </p>

    <p>
<b>NOTE:</b> 'PVar's are modeled closely on the 'IVar' implementation in the
       ivar-simple package.  The major difference is that if you try
       to read an IVar before it has been given a value, it blocks
       until the value is available, whereas reading from a 'PVar'
       before it is ready raises an exception.  The reason behind the
       different symantics for 'PVar' is because if the user accidently
       accesses the value too early, you want there to be a lot of
       noise to let him or her know about it, rather than merely
       blocking the thread indefinitely and causing them to wonder
       what went wrong.</p>
